					<h5><b>Reduction of Dynamic Range Ratio through Competition Over Resources to synthesize planar array antennas</b></h5>
					<p><b> AEU-International Journal of Electronics and Communications (2016) </b></p>
					<p><b>Authors:</b> Gholami, R., Zakeri, B., Abedi, H., <b>Mohseni, S.</b></p>
					<p>
						<b>Abstract:</b> To synthesize planar arrays, a new optimization algorithm namely Competition Over Resources (COR) is presented. This method imposes deeper nulls with the constraint of Side Lobe Level (SLL). COR is a new meta-heuristic algorithm based on competitive behavior of animal groups over food resources. The algorithm restricts Dynamic Range Ratio (DRR) in order to achieve a better control of the mutual coupling and feed network. Simulation results for optimal patterns, possessing multiple and broad nulls, are presented. The approach is implemented based on the position-only and the space/amplitude optimization. Furthermore, in order to find the better performance in imposing deeper nulls and reducing SLL, a comparative evaluation between Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and COR is presented. Numerical results show that COR has better performance compared with PSO.

					<h5><b>A Human-Grounded Evaluation Benchmark for Local Explanations of Machine Learning</b></h5>		
					<p><b> Submitted to CHI LBW 2018 </b></p>
					<p><b>Authors:</b> <b> Sina Mohseni</b>, Eric Ragan</p>				
					<p>
						<b>Abstract:</b> In order for people to be able to trust and take advantage of the results of advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions for real decision making, people need to be able to understand the machine rationale for given output. Research in explain artificial intelligence (XAI) addresses the aim, but there is a need for evaluation of human relevance and understandability of explanations. Our work contributes a novel methodology for evaluating the quality or human interpretability of explanations for machine learning models. We present an evaluation benchmark for instance explanations from text and image classifiers. The explanation meta-data in this benchmark is generated from user annotations of image and text samples. We describe the benchmark and demonstrate its utility by a quantitative evaluation on explanations generated from a recent machine learning algorithm. This research demonstrates how human-grounded evaluation could be used as a measure to qualify local machine-learning explanations.

					<h5><b>Competition over resources algorithm and its application for planar array pattern synthesis</b></h5>		
					<p><b> 8th International Symposium on Telecommunications (IEEE IST) (2016) </b></p>
					<p><b>Authors:</b> Abedi, H., Gholami, R., Zakeri, B., & <b> Mohseni, S. </b></p>				
					<p>
						<b>Abstract:</b> This paper will investigate a method of synthesizing planar arrays through the application of a new optimization algorithm based on competitive behavior of animal groups that will impose deeper nulls in the interfering direction with the constraint of a reduced Side Lobe Level (SLL). Simulation results for optimal patterns by position-only and both the element space and amplitude controlling with the imposed single and double nulls are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. In the following, after a general explanation of the algorithm, a comparison of obtained results with particle swarm optimizations, as a well-known heuristic algorithm, is presented. Furthermore, in order to set which design case could provide a better performance in imposed deeper nulls and side lobe reduction, a comparative evaluation of both proposed methods (position-only, position and amplitude) will be done. Finally, the optimized design case with a uniform planar array will be achieved. Also, the proposed algorithm on array antenna synthesis, shows faster and superior results compared to other optimization algorithms.

					<h5><b>Automatic system for detection critical conditions in overhead lines distribution insulators based on leakage current analysis</b></h5>
					<p><b> 52nd Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference (IEEE/IAS I&CPS) (2016)</b></p>
					<p><b>Authors:</b> Faramarzi, M., Tabibzadeh, M., <b> Mohseni, S.</b>, & Jafari, M.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Abstract:</b> In this paper, a new automatic system has been proposed for critical conditions diagnosis of distribution insulators. In this regard, a variety of experiments have been conducted on different types of insulators under different environmental conditions. Leakage current harmonics on these experiments have been analyzed. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) applied on leakage current waveforms and results show a strong correlation between third to fifth harmonics amplitude ratio regarding to insulators conditions. Therefore, third to fifth harmonics ratio of leakage current (R3/5) has been proposed as an indicator to diagnosis critical conditions in distribution insulators. Results demonstrate if value of index R3/5 becomes more than unit, it will be critical condition for insulator and high probability of flashover occurrence. Hence, an automatic system designed for critical conditions detection and flashover prediction using the index R3/5.

					<h5><b>Facial Expression Recognition Based on Anatomical Structure of Human Face</b></h5>
					<p><b> Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering Innovations (2014) </b></p>
					<p><b>Authors:</b>  <b> Mohseni, Sina</b>, Gholamreza Ardeshir, and Niloofar Zarei</p>
					<p>
						<b>Abstract:</b> Automatic analysis of human facial expressions is one of the challenging problems in machine vision systems. It has many applications in human-computer interactions such as, social signal processing, social robots, deceit detection, interactive video and behavior monitoring. In this paper, we develop a new method for automatic facial expression recognition based on facial muscle anatomy and human face structure. The algorithm finds approximate location of effective facial muscles and extracts features by measuring skin texture in 11 local patches. Seven facial expressions, including neutral are being classified in this study using AdaBoost classifier and other classifiers on MMI databases. Experimental results show that analyzing skin texture from selected local patches gives accurate and efficient information in order to identify different facial expressions.

					<h5><b>A Novel Method for Current Harmonic Reduction of CFLs in Large Number Usage</b></h5>
					<p><b> 6th Power Electronics, Drives Systems & Technologies Conference (IEEE PEDSTC) (2015) </b></p>
					<p><b>Authors:</b> Hassanzadeh, M., Sheikholeslami, A., Ghoreishi, H., <b>Mohseni, S.</b>, & Nazari, M.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Abstract:</b> This paper proposes a method to achieve the harmonic cancellation of compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) in large number usage. As the adoption of CFLs shows no sign of slowing down, utilities are increasingly concerned with the harmonic impact of these lamps. However it is obvious that traditional incandescent lamps will be replaced with energy efficient lamps only if they stay in a reasonable price. This paper presents a novel cost effective power quality correction method. The implemented method is based on the effect of capacitor-filter size on current THD in CFLs, used in large numbers. With this aim, we have simulated 120 CFLs in parallel to discuss the impact of capacitor filter size on harmonics when the CFLs are integrated and also some experiments have been done in laboratory to show the cancellation effect. The experimental results reveal that more attenuation will occur in higher harmonic orders. To capture harmonic characteristics of sample lamps, a power recorder compatible with personal computer had been used and the data had been analyzed in MATLAB program. Both simulation and laboratory test results verify the theoretical analysis.

					<h5><b>Driving point impedance restriction in synthesis of linear antenna arrays using competition over resources optimization algorithm</b></h5>
					<p><b> 4th International eConference on Computer and Knowledge Engineering (IEEE ICCKE) (2014) </b></p>
					<p><b>Authors:</b> Gholami, R., <b>Mohseni, S.</b>, Zakeri, B., & Abedi, H</p>

						<b>Abstract:</b> In the recent years, many heuristic optimization algorithms derived from the behavior of biological or physical systems in nature have been developed. In this paper, we propose a new optimization algorithm based on competitive behavior of group animals. The competition gradually results in an increase in population of wealthy group which gives a fast convergence to the optimization algorithm. In the following, after a detailed explanation of the algorithm and pseudo code, we compare it with particle swarm optimizations as a famous heuristic algorithm. The proposed method is used to determine an optimal set of amplitude weights of antennas and element spacing that satisfy the optimal goal during constant first null beamwidth (FNBW) for aperiodic linear array. It is to be noted that the desired prescribed nulls depth and side lobes level (SLL) is achieved simultaneously with the narrowest possible FNBW. In addition, because of practical consideration in array antennas, restriction of driving-point impedance (DPI) of each element is proposed during pattern synthesis. Final array factor without and with impedance optimization are compared with uniform amplitude excitation and equal element spacing array factor as reference. The proposed algorithm on known array antenna synthesis, shows faster and superior results compared to other optimization algorithms.

					<h5><b>Facial expression recognition using anatomy based facial graph</b></h5>
					<p><b> IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (IEEE SMC) (2014)  </b></p>
					<p><b>Authors:</b> <b>Mohseni, Sina</b>, Niloofar Zarei, and Saba Ramazani</p>
					<p>
						<b>Abstract:</b> Automatic analysis of human facial emotions is one of the challenging problems in intelligent systems and social signal processing. It has many applications in human-computer interactions, social robots, interactive multimedia and behavior monitoring. In this paper, our specific aim is to develop a method for facial movement recognition based on verifying movable facial elements and estimate the movements after any facial expressions. The algorithm plots a face model graph based on facial expression muscles in each frame and extracts features by measuring facial graph edges' size and angle variations. Seven facial expressions, including neutral pose are being classified in this study using support vector machine and other classifiers on MMI databases. The approach does not rely on action unit system, and therefore eliminates errors which are otherwise propagated to the final result due to incorrect initial identification of action units. Experimental results show that analyzing facial movements gives accurate and efficient information in order to identify different facial expressions.

					<h5><b>Competition Over Resources: A New Optimization Algorithm Based on Animals Behavioral Ecology</b></h5>
					<p><b> International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems (IEEE INCoS), (2014) </b></p>
					<p><b>Authors:</b> <b>Mohseni, S.</b>, Gholami, R., Zarei, N., & Zadeh, A. R.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Abstract:</b> In the recent years, many heuristic optimization algorithms have been developed. A majority of these heuristic algorithms have been derived from the behavior of biological or physical systems in nature. In this paper, we propose a new optimization algorithm based on competitive behavior of animal groups. In the proposed algorithm, the whole population is divided into a number of groups. In each group, the best searching agent spreads its children in its owned territory. Any group which is not able to find rich resources will be eliminated form competition. The competition gradually results in an increase in population of wealthy group which gives a fast convergence to proposed optimization algorithm. In the following, after a detailed explanation of the algorithm and pseudo code, we compare it to other existing algorithms, including genetics and particle swarm optimizations. Applying the proposed algorithm on various benchmark cost functions, shows faster and superior results compared to other optimization algorithms.

						<b>Abstract:</b> Automatic analysis of human facial expression is one of the challenging problems in machine vision systems. It has many applications in human-computer interactions, social robots, deceit detection, interactive video and behavior monitoring. In this paper, we developed a new method for automatic facial expression recognition based on verifying movable facial elements and tracking nodes in sequential frames. The algorithm plots a face model graph in each frame and extracts features by measuring the ratio of the facial graph sides. Seven facial expressions, including neutral pose are being classified in this study using support vector machine and other classifiers on JAFFE databases. The approach does not rely on action units, and therefore eliminates errors which are otherwise propagated to the final result due to incorrect initial identification of action units. Experimental results show that analyzing facial movements gives accurate and efficient information in order to identify different facial expressions.

					<h5><b>Facial Expression Recognition Using DCT Features and Neural Network Based Decision Tree</b></h5>
					<p><b> 55th International Symposium ELMAR 2013 (IEEE ELMAR) (2013)</b></p>
					<p><b>Authors:</b> <b>Mohseni, Sina</b>, Hussain Montazeri Kordy, and Ramin Ahmadi</p>
					<p>
						<b>Abstract:</b> Automatic analysis of human facial expression is one of the challenging problems in machine vision systems. The most expressive way humans display emotion is through facial expression. In this paper, we extend texture based facial expression recognition, with a method of 2D image processing implemented for extraction of features and a new neural network based decision trees. The algorithm applies a set of preprocessing and divides the image into two main parts (eyes and lips apart), and implements Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) on each part to reduce image data size in different parts of the face. Different decision tree models have been tried in order to find the best recognition rate. Experimental results show that, such a combination of decision tree with neural network to identify different facial expressions improves the recognition rate significantly.

					<h5><b>ProvThreads: Analytic Provenance Visualization and Segmentation</b></h5>		
					<p><b> IEEE VIS 2017 </b></p>
					<p>
						<b>Abstract:</b> Our work aims to generate visualizations to enable meta-analysis of analytic provenance and aid better understanding of analysts' strategies during exploratory text analysis. 
						We introduce ProvThreads, a visual analytics approach that incorporates interactive topic modeling outcomes to illustrate relationships between user interactions and the data topics under investigation.
						ProvThreads uses a series of continuous analysis paths called topic threads to demonstrate both topic coverage and the progression of an investigation over time.
						As an analyst interacts with different pieces of data during the analysis, interactions are logged and used to track user interests in topics over time.
						A line chart shows different amounts of interest in multiple topics over the duration of the analysis.
						We discuss how different configurations of ProvThreads can be used to reveal changes in focus throughout an analysis.

					<h5><b>Analytic Provenance Datasets: A Data Repository of Human Analysis Activity and Interaction Logs [<i>Preprint</i>] </b></h5>		
					<p><b> Submitted to CHI LBW 2018 </b></p>
					<p>
						<b>Abstract:</b> We present an analytic provenance data repository that can be used to study human analysis activity, thought processes, and software interaction with visual analysis tools during exploratory data analysis.
						We conducted a series of user studies involving exploratory data analysis scenario with textual and cyber security data.
						Interactions logs, think-alouds, videos and all coded data in this study are available online for research purposes.
						Analysis sessions are segmented in multiple sub-task steps based on user think-alouds, video and audios captured during the studies. 
						These analytic provenance datasets can be used for research involving tools and techniques for analyzing interaction logs and analysis history.
						By providing high-quality coded data along with interaction logs, it is possible to compare algorithmic data processing techniques to the ground-truth records of analysis history.
