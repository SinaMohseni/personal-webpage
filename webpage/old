                        Interpretable machine learning is a branch of mashin learning systems that are able to give explanations to 
                        the user (human) about their output (decisions). 
                        Why do we need explanations from machines? How can we obtain explanation from complex deep neural network? and How can we measure 
                        quality of explanations? are interesting research questions in both HCI and Maching Learning communities.

                        This project is about designing a user interface for users in healthcare community.
                        We design a user interface for text classifier which classifies articles from online healthcare forums into symptom and medication topics.
                        The user interface highlights words and phrases related to 
                        This user interface is built to support explanations from healthcare data classifiers presented in 
                        <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jhe/2017/2460174/" target="_blank">this paper</a>
